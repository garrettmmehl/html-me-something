                Hollow knight is a video game that was released in early 2017. It's a 2D, metroidvania-style game where you explore
                the unknown land of Hollownest. It's also one of my favorite games.

                    <p class=text-right>
                        You play as the Knight, who is a small bug who wields a nail as his weapon. His goal is to cleanse Hollownest
                        of "the infection." Throughout the game, he will get power-ups and spells that allow him to venture further
                        through Hollownest.

                        Hornet is an NPC who wields a needle as her weapon. She is very distrustful of the Knight. You face her in 
                        combat before she becomes an ally. A sequel to Hollow Knight is in development where you play as Hornet.

                        Cornifer is a map maker who charts out the areas, giving you the option to purchase his maps for a small amount
                        of geo (the currency of Hollownest).

                    <p class=text-left>
                        Zote is the most powerful warrior in the game, and he isn't afraid to tell everyone how strong he really is.
                        His power is truly staggering, and he demonstrates it consistently throughout the game.

                    <p class=text-right>
                        This is the first boss of the game. He isn't too much of a challenge, but he gives the player a chance to
                        test out what their nail can truly do.

                    <p class=text-left>
                        This is the "final" boss of the game. You spend the entire game breaking into his tomb to properly destroy him,
                        but what does defeating him truly accomplish?

                        At long last, the player gets to face off against the world renown Zote, but Grey Prince Zote is bigger and better
                        than Zote himself. Who knew it was actually possible?

                    <p class=text-left>
                        This is one of my personal favorite bosses. He was the first boss that took me several attempts to beat and required
                        me to fight proactively instead of reactively as I had been throughout the game.

                    <p class=text-right>
                        The focus spell allows you to channel your SOUL (a mana-like resource) to heal yourself. It's crucial throughout 
                        the game as your main means of staying alive.

                    <p class=text-left>
                        This spell is an offensive spell that uses SOUL to fire forth an attack from the Knight. It's stronger than a 
                        simple nail hit, but it can't be used all the time since it is limited by SOUL. Later in the game, it can be 
                        upgraded to Shade Soul.

                    <p class=text-right>
                        This spell causes the knight to slam down into the ground to deal damage and break through weak floors. 
                        Additionally, it can be used to dodge certain attacks as it gives the Knight a moment of invulnerability. This 
                        can be upgraded into Descending Dark.

                    <p class=text-left>
                        This is the strongest spell in the game. However, it can only be used from below the enemy that you're 
                        trying to attack. Howling Wraiths can be upgraded into Abyss Shriek.
